This build plugin is a utility for enabling server-side rendering in Next.js on Netlify. It wraps your application in a tiny compatibility layer, so that pages can use Netlify Functions to be server-side rendered.

## Installation and Configuration

Create a `netlify.toml` in the root of your project:

```toml
[build]
  command   = "npm run build"
  functions = "out_functions"
  publish = "out_publish"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

## Custom Netlify Redirects

You can define custom redirects in a `_redirects` and/or in your `netlify.toml` file.
The precedence of these rules are:

- `_redirects`
- `next-on-netlify` redirects
- `netlify.toml`

[Read more about Netlify redirects here](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/).

## Custom Netlify Functions

`next-on-netlify` creates one Netlify Function for each of your
SSR pages and API endpoints. It is currently not possible to create custom Netlify Functions. Let me know if you have a need for this feature and we can add it.

## Caveats

### Fallbacks for Pages with `getStaticPaths`

[Fallback pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-true) behave differently with this plugin than they do with Next.js. On Next.js, when navigating to a path that is not defined in `getStaticPaths`, it first displays the fallback page. Next.js then generates the HTML in the background and caches it for future requests.

With this plugin, when navigating to a path that is not defined in `getStaticPaths`, it server-side renders the page and sends it directly to the user. The user never sees the fallback page. The page is not cached for future requests.
