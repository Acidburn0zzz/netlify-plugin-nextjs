# Next on Netlify Build Plugin

This build plugin is a utility for enabling server-side rendering in Next.js on Netlify. It wraps your application in a tiny compatibility layer, so that pages can use Netlify Functions to be server-side rendered.

**TL;DR: You can enable SSR in your Next.js applications with 3 simple steps, listed [here](#setup)!**

## Installation and Configuration

Create a `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  command   = "npm run build"
  functions = "out_functions"
  publish   = "out_publish"
```

## Setup

#### 1. Set Next.js target to serverless

We must build our Next.js app as a serverless app. You can read more about serverless Next.js [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/build-target#serverless-target).

It's super simple. Just create a `next.config.js` file and write the following:

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  // Target must be serverless
  target: "serverless",
}
```

If binaries are needed in the deployment the following configuration is needed ([Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) is an example):

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  // Target must be experimental-serverless-trace
  // Your build time will be longer with this option
  target: "experimental-serverless-trace",
}
```

#### 2. Add postbuild hook

The next-on-netlify package adds the `next-on-netlify` command. When we run this command, some magic happens to prepare our Next.js app for hosting on Netlify\*.

We want the next-on-netlify command to run after we build our NextJS application. So let's add a postbuild hook to our package.json file:

```json
{
  "name": "my-nextjs-app",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "postbuild": "next-on-netlify"
  },
  ....
}
```

\*If you're curious about the "magic", check out the well-documented [`next-on-netlify.js` file](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/blob/master/next-on-netlify.js).

We're done. Let's deploy ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Optional Extras

#### Preview Locally

I recommend you still use `next dev` to build and preview your application locally.

But if you want to emulate the Netlify deployment on your computer, you can also run `next-on-netlify` locally and then use `netlify-cli` to preview the result.

First, install the latest version of `netlify-cli` (you can also [look at package.json](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/blob/master/package.json) to see the version that next-on-netlify has been tested against):

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Then, add the following `[dev]` block to your `netlify.toml`:

```toml
# netlify.toml

# [build]
#   ...

[dev]
  functions = "out_functions"
  publish   = "out_publish"
  # We manually set the framework to static, otherwise Netlify automatically
  # detects Next.js and redirects do not work.
  # Read more: https://github.com/netlify/cli/blob/master/docs/netlify-dev.md#project-detection
  framework = "#static"
```

Lastly, add the following lines to your `.gitignore`:

```shell
# .gitignore

# Files generated by next-on-netlify command
/out_publish/
/out_functions/
```

Now you're all set.

From now on, whenever you want to preview your application locally, just run:

1. `npm run build`: This will run `next build` to build your Next.js app and `next-on-netlify` to prepare your Next.js app for compatibility with Netlify
1. `netlify dev`: This will emulate Netlify on your computer and let you preview your app on `http://localhost:8888`.

#### Custom Netlify Redirects

You can define custom redirects in a `_redirects` and/or in your `netlify.toml` file.
The precedence of these rules are:

- `_redirects`
- `next-on-netlify` redirects
- `netlify.toml`

[Read more about Netlify redirects here](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/).

#### Custom Netlify Functions

`next-on-netlify` creates one Netlify Function for each of your
SSR pages and API endpoints. It is currently not possible to create custom Netlify Functions. Let me know if you have a need for this feature and we can add it.

## Caveats

### Preview Mode

[Next.js Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode) does not work on pages that are pre-rendered (pages with `getStaticProps`). Netlify currently does not support cookie-based redirects, which are needed for supporting preview mode on pre-rendered pages. Preview mode works correctly on any server-side-rendered pages (pages with `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps`). See: [Issue #10](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/10)

### Fallbacks for Pages with `getStaticPaths`

[Fallback pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-true) behave differently with `next-on-netlify` than they do with Next.js. On Next.js, when navigating to a path that is not defined in `getStaticPaths`, it first displays the fallback page. Next.js then generates the HTML in the background and caches it for future requests.

With `next-on-netlify`, when navigating to a path that is not defined in `getStaticPaths`, it server-side renders the page and sends it directly to the user. The user never sees the fallback page. The page is not cached for future requests.
